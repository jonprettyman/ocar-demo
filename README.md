# One Cambia Architecture Process

This project is intended to allow folks to demo the proposed One Cambia
Architecture decision making process as proposed by Max Templeton, Jon
Prettyman, Darren Cruickshank and Tim Mickol.  Primarily focusing on how github
"through the web" editing, branching, pull-requesting could work.

## Steps so far

* Created a personally owned, public repo just to not pollute the Cambia github
  namespace.  Tuned configuration to require pull-requests - but not much else.
* installed adr-tools - just because why not? `brew install adr-tools`
* cloned locally and created `initial-structure` branch
* ran `adr-init`
* started editing this readme
