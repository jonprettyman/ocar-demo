# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-09-06

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions that the One Cambia Architecture Team makes and have a well defined process with visibility supporting them.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).  We will support this with a Jira based process integrated with a github pull-request flow that supports the lifecycle captured in this [Lucid Chart diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/19d3e9ef-de3a-4d1a-9a0c-11c578c3cee9/edit?viewport_loc=-136%2C-313%2C3776%2C2328%2C.AENuaccRJqv&invitationId=inv_80acf706-1331-4b11-b211-4335af7a09cf#).


## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
